*Try changing bitmap format (al_set_new_bitmap_format) to see if I 
get any performance boosts

*Adjust character movement so it is more natural and smooth

*Make it so when you move and you release the button, it
gradually slows down instead of going to a dead stop

*Fix collision detection

*Add Seren attack animations (when Will has them ready)

*3D Terrain 

*Use PhysFS archives for image, music, and other game resources
